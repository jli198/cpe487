# Lab 2: Four-Digit Hex Counter

* Build a four-digit (16-bit) [counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_(digital)) to display its value on 7-segment displays (See Section 9.1 Seven-Segment Display of the [Refenece Manual](https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/nexys-a7_rm.pdf))

* The counter module generates a 16-bit count value using bits 23 to 38 of the 39-bit binary counter at a frequency of 100 MHz / 2<sup>23</sup> ≈ 12 Hz with a complete cycle taking approximately 16<sup>4</sup> / 12 ≈ 5461 seconds or 91 minutes

* The binary counter bits 17 and 18 generate a 0 to 3 count sequence at a frequency of 100 MHz / 2<sup>17</sup> ≈ 763 Hz

* The sequence repeats at a frequency of approximately 763 Hz / 4  ≈ 191 Hz that is fast enough to eliminate any visual flicker in the displays.

* This multiplexing is fast enough (at least 60 complete cycles per second) to appear as if all four displays are continuously illuminated – each with their own four bits of information.

* The mpx output from the new counter module now drives the dig input of the leddec module.

* The mpx signal is also used to select which 4-bits of the 16-bit count output should be sent to the data input of the leddec module.

* By time multiplexing the 7-segment displays that share the same cathode lines (CA to CG), four different digits can appear on one display at a time.
  * Turn on display 0 for a few milliseconds by enabling its common anode AN0 and decoding count (0~3) to drive the cathode lines.
  * Switch to display 1 for a few milliseconds by turning off AN0, turning on AN1 and decoding count (4~7) to drive the cathode lines.
  * Shift to display 2 for a few milliseconds and then finally display 3 for a few milliseconds, after that go back and start again at display 0.
  * Each digit is thus illuminated only one quarter of the time

### 1. Create a new RTL project called _hex4count_ in Vivado Quick Start

* Click 'Create File' then create three new source files of file type VHDL called **_leddec_**, **_counter_**, and **_hexcount_**

* Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called **_hexcount_**

* Default Part > Boards > Vendor: digilentinc.com > Name: Nexys A7-100T > Click Nexys A7-100T > Next

* New Project Summary > Finish

* Click design sources, copy leddec.vhd, counter.vhd, and hexcount.vhd from the GitHub Raw, and save files

* Click constraints, copy hexcount.xdc from the GitHub Raw, and save file

### 2. Run synthesis

### 3. Run implementation

### 4. Open implemented design

* Tools > Edit Device Properties > Configuration Modes > Check "Master SPI x1"

### 5. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

* Click 'Generate Bitstream'

* Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

* Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download hex4counter.runs/impl_1/hexcount.bit to the Nexys A7-100T board

* The four digit counter counts from 0000 to FFFF (see [Modifications](https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd/tree/master/Nexys-A7/Lab-2/Modifications) for an eight-digit counter)

### 6. Generate and boot from configuration memory, and close project

* Move the blue MODE jumper on the board from [JTAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG) to QSPI (Quad-[SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface))
  * [Refenece Manual](https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/nexys-a7_rm.pdf) Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 3.2

    * When I got to this step, it would not allow me to select this PRM file. The rest of the process seemed to go correctly without this step, so for now if this happens to you just move on to the next step - Prof. Yett

* Right click xc7a100t_0 under "Hardware" > Boot from Configuration Memory Device > The four digit counter starts

* File > Close Hardware Manager 

* File > Close Project 

* POWER OFF > POWER ON > Wait for 10 seconds > The counter starts

## Lab Report Feedback - 95%

More specifically for the "only flip between 0 and 1 one time" requirement, we would likely never recognize other types of sequences as part of the counter logic. There are a couple of exceptions (the very smallest bit keeps flipping back and forth between 0 and 1, and the second smallest bit keeps repeating 00110011...), but this is the only approach that will actually work for the vast majority of the bits we are observing. </br>
This can be remedied by explaining that detecting a bit flip only once is easier for the program to find.
